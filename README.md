Shopeeng – E-Commerce MVP

Shopeeng is a minimalist e-commerce application built using React JS and Tailwind CSS. This project was developed to fulfill a bootcamp requirement of building a minimum viable product (MVP) for an online store that utilizes a real API, includes cart and checkout functionality, and showcases front-end development fundamentals.

The design was loosely inspired by Shopee, with simplified features tailored to demonstrate core e-commerce functionality.
